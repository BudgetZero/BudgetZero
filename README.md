2. Installing the desktop app (Windows or Mac). [Download here](https://github.com/budgetzero/budgetzero/releases/latest)
3. Self host the web app. You can either deploy the docker image (recommended) or build and host the static files on your own webserver. See deployment section below for more details. 

# Deployment
## Docker 
```
docker pull budgetzero/budgetzero:latest
```
Then run with 
```
docker run -d -p <desired_port>:8080 --name budgetzero budgetzero/budgetzero
```
Example:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name budgetzero budgetzero/budgetzero
```
Your budgetzero instance is now running at <docker_IP>:<desired_port>

## Manual Deployment
You can also build the static files and host on any webserver.
```
npm install
npm run build
```
The files will be built into the dist/ folder and can be hosted anywhere.


# Development
## Pull Requests

Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are a greatly appreciated.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise, you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not get accepted or is already in development.

## Dev Setup
```
npm install
```

### To start a development web server:
```
npm run serve
```

### Run tests
Run all tests once:
```
npm run test:unit
```

Run all tests and re-run if files change:  
```
npm run test-watch:unit
```

Run with debugger (chrome://inspect)
```
node --inspect node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand tests/unit/Transactions.spec.js
